      We care about your privacy. We don't require you to create an account to
      use Thingbomb and we don't use any third-party cookies. Many privacy
      regulations require us to stuff a lot inside our privacy policy, so if you
      don't need to read the full version, here's a quick rundown:

    <h2 class="text-xl font-bold">User Rights Under GDPR</h2>
    <p class="text-base">
      While we do not collect personally identifiable information (PII)
      directly, EU users have certain rights under GDPR regarding any data that
      may be processed by our third-party providers. These rights include:
    </p>
    <ul class="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2">
      <li>
        <strong>Right of Access</strong>: The right to request access to your
        personal data (if any), but since we do not store PII directly, we
        cannot process such a request. You may need to contact{" "}
        <strong>Cloudflare</strong> for any data they may have processed regarding
        your interactions with our website.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Right to Rectification</strong>: The right to request that any
        inaccurate or incomplete data be corrected. Since we don’t store PII, we
        cannot fulfill this request directly. For any corrections to data
        processed by our third-party providers (such as Cloudflare), please
        refer to their privacy policies.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Right to Erasure</strong>: The right to request the deletion of
        your personal data from our systems. However, we do not store PII
        ourselves, so we cannot directly delete any data. For data that may be
        processed by <strong>Cloudflare</strong>, please refer to their privacy
        policy for instructions on how to exercise your right to erasure.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Right to Restriction of Processing</strong>: You have the right
        to request the restriction of processing of your personal data. We do
        not process PII directly, so this request would need to be directed to
        our third-party service providers.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Right to Data Portability</strong>: You have the right to
        receive your personal data in a structured, commonly used, and
        machine-readable format. While IP addresses are technically portable,
        they are linked to your network and not specific to our platform. We
        don’t store them in a long-term or user-specific way, but you still have
        the right to request portability of any personal data we collect.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Right to Object</strong>: You have the right to object to the
        processing of your personal data. Since we do not store personal data,
        this right would primarily apply to our third-party providers, like <strong
          >Cloudflare</strong
        >, who may process certain data for security or performance purposes.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Right to Complain</strong>: You have the right to complain to a
        data protection authority if you believe that your rights have been
        infringed.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p class="text-base">
      Since we do not store personally identifiable information (PII) ourselves,
      any requests related to these rights must be directed to the third-party
      service providers that handle your data, except for the right to complain
      if applicable. For more details, please consult their privacy policies
